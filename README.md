An Elixir library wrapping the Microsoft graph API
# DO NOT USE
There simply wasn't a library for Elixir that was able to talk to Microsofts graph API. This SHOULD NOT BE USED as it is very new and has next to no features. When it has enough features to do the basics I will indicate so. 
This library is being used for an internal project but we thought it would be great to open source it, in around 4-6 months it should be ready to do the basics, but until then it will be strictly used internally.
